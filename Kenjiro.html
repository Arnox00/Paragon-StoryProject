          <h2>Appearance &amp; Description</h2>

          <h3>Human Form (Miyamoto Kenjiro)</h3>
          <p>Miyamoto Kenjiro appears as the epitome of a refined samurai master. Standing tall with an elegant, deceptively slender frame, he carries himself with the fluid grace of someone who has achieved perfect harmony between mind and body. His long, flowing black hair moves naturally with each motion, often catching the wind in a way that seems almost choreographed.</p>

          <p>His most distinctive feature is his perpetually closed eyes—narrow, fox-like slits that give him an expression of serene contentment. When he smiles, which is often, it appears genuine and warm, creating an immediate sense of trust and comfort in those around him. This pleasant demeanor masks the calculating intelligence beneath, as he constantly analyzes everyone he meets as potential opponents.</p>

          <p>He wears pristine traditional samurai attire: a perfectly maintained green kimono over dark hakama, with not a thread out of place. At his waist rest two masterwork katanas—Onimaru and Oniyasha—in their dormant state, appearing as elegant temple blades with ornate golden fittings. His hands are unmarked by the blackened fingertips of his later form, and his skin bears no trace of the crimson markings that will come to define him.</p>

          <h3>Demon Form (Onizōo)</h3>
          <p>After his transformation into a Shura, he becomes something far more terrifying. His face remains hidden beneath the massive straw hat (sugegasa) that casts perpetual shadows, with only glowing eyes visible beneath its brim like twin embers burning in the darkness. He also seems to be wearing a youkai-like mask that has a horrifying grin. His flowing black hair has transformed into living crimson flames—a physical manifestation of the demon of hatred burning within him.</p>

          <p>His once-pristine clothing is now tattered and worn, dissolving at the edges into red mist. The golden cord that ties his outfit is the only bright element remaining in his otherwise dark appearance. His hands bear blackened fingertips, permanently stained by the blood of countless victims, and faint crimson markings resembling flowing blood vessels trace across his pale skin.</p>

          <p>Most terrifying of all are his twin katanas, now permanently stained crimson from his transformation. The blades seem to weep blood constantly, dripping with flames that burn like liquid agony—a corruption of their original sacred purpose as temple guardians.</p>

        <div class="card personality">
          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <h3>Human Form</h3>
          <p>Kenjiro presents himself as the ideal of samurai refinement—polite, thoughtful, and deeply knowledgeable about martial arts and philosophy. He speaks with gentle wisdom and appears genuinely interested in others' wellbeing. This facade is so convincing that many seek him out as a mentor or guide, making him the perfect predator.</p>

          <p>However, beneath this pleasant exterior lies the mind of a psychopath who views every interaction through the lens of combat. He compliments others' sword techniques while mentally cataloging their weaknesses. He discusses philosophy while fantasizing about how each person might die. His perpetually closed eyes hide not serenity, but constant calculation and predatory assessment.</p>

          <h3>Demon Form</h3>
          <p>As a Shura, his mask of civility has largely fallen away, though he retains his formal speech patterns and samurai courtesies in a twisted mockery of his former self. He speaks about combat with the enthusiasm most people reserve for beloved hobbies, discussing the most efficient ways to kill with genuine excitement and religious fervor.</p>

          <p>He becomes increasingly agitated when not fighting, like an addict denied their fix. His psychopathic tendencies are now fully unleashed, though he maintains enough of his original personality to appreciate worthy technique and respect honorable combat. He views each battle as both a test of skill and a ritual sacrifice to his demonic nature.</p>

        <div class="card relationships">
          <h2>Relationships</h2>
          <p><strong>With Arnox Paragon:</strong> Their clash during Arnox's honeymoon catalyzed Kenjiro's transformation. Kenjiro respected Arnox as the expression of combat prowess; when Arnox pierced him with Twilight's Peak, Kenjiro's hatred fused with yokai essence instead of letting him pass on.</p>

          <p><strong>With Ashur Paragon:</strong> Onizōo recognizes Ashur as the child present during the duel that ended Kenjiro's life. He taunts Ashur to awaken the bloodlust Kenjiro believes lies dormant.</p>

          <p><strong>With Reveille:</strong> Reveille's survival and trauma intrigue him. He sees potential in Reveille's pain as material to awaken killing intent.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-content" aria-hidden="true">
        <h2>Character Background &amp; Lore</h2>

        <h3>The Path to Becoming Shura</h3>
        <p>Miyamoto Kenjiro was born into a prestigious samurai family that operated hot springs in the Ashina lands, showing exceptional talent with the blade from an early age. However, unlike other warriors who fought for honor, duty, or protection, Kenjiro discovered an uncomfortable truth about himself—he genuinely enjoyed the act of killing. Not the victory, not the honor, but the precise moment when life left his opponent's eyes.</p>

        <p>This realization didn't horrify him as it should have. Instead, it fascinated him. He began seeking out increasingly dangerous opponents under the guise of maintaining order, systematically hunting down temple guardians and sacred sites across the mountain villages. Each kill fed a growing hunger within him, gradually transforming him from a disciplined samurai into something far more dangerous.</p>

        <h3>The Sacred Blades</h3>
        <p>He acquired the cursed twin blades Onimaru and Oniyasha from a mountain temple after slaughtering its protectors, including the young priest Reveille's village guardians. These swords, originally forged to ward off evil spirits and protect the innocent, instead became conduits for his growing bloodlust. The irony was not lost on him—weapons meant to protect had become instruments of his corruption.</p>

        <h3>The Fateful Encounter</h3>
        <p>His path to becoming a Shura culminated when he encountered Arnox and Arielle exploring Fukuwa city during the annual crimson moon festival in their honeymoon. The unique couple had become the talk of the town—their exotic beauty and obvious power drawing attention. But Kenjiro sensed something deeper in Arnox: the dormant bloodlust of a warrior who had killed countless foes across multiple worlds.</p>

        <p>Introducing himself as esteemed local royalty, Kenjiro offered them guidance about the festival and exclusive access to his family's private hot springs resort. His facade was perfect—the gracious host welcoming distinguished guests. It was at these hot springs that Arielle gave birth to Ashur after a passionate encounter with Arnox, and Kenjiro played the role of supportive attendant throughout.</p>

        <p>However, the crimson moon's supernatural influence gradually eroded his self-control. During the intimate family moment, his mask finally slipped—he casually confessed to being responsible for the festival's missing people, the bodies found cleaved in the alleys. When Arnox righteously demanded a duel, Kenjiro initially tried to deflect, not understanding why his "pest control" was problematic.</p>

        <p>Everything changed when Arnox drew Twilight's Peak. The sight of that magnificent nodachi filled Kenjiro with such awe that he immediately accepted the challenge. His facade dropped completely, revealing the bloodlusted psychopath beneath who craved to witness and awaken Arnox's true swordsmanship.</p>

        <p>The battle was magnificent and terrible. For the first time in years, Kenjiro felt truly alive as Arnox's dormant battle instincts awakened. But when Arnox's Twilight Severance pierced his heart beneath the crimson moon, instead of finding peace in death, his hatred and bloodlust refused to let him pass on.</p>

        <h3>The Crimson Rebirth</h3>
        <p>Arnox, respecting his fallen opponent, performed a funeral ceremony on the Gojo Bridge. As the flames consumed Kenjiro's body under the crimson moon, his intense negative emotions fused with the yokai essence that permeates the Ashina lands. The fire that should have freed his soul instead became the crucible for his transformation into Onizōo—a Shura bound to eternal unrest, his sacred blades forever corrupted by his burning hatred.</p>

        <h3>Centuries of Wandering</h3>
        <p>As Onizōo, he became trapped in an endless cycle of seeking worthy opponents to feed his Shura bloodlust. Each battle only intensified his need for greater challenges, creating a never-ending spiral of violence. He haunts the Ashina lands, drawn to conflict and the scent of strong warriors, forever seeking to recreate that perfect moment of combat he experienced with Arnox—and to corrupt others as he himself was corrupted.</p>

        <h3>Personality &amp; Motivations</h3>
        <p><strong>Human Form:</strong> Kenjiro presents himself as the ideal of samurai refinement—polite, thoughtful, and deeply knowledgeable. This facade is so convincing many seek him as a mentor. Beneath the mask is a psychopathic predator who finds joy only in combat.</p>

        <p><strong>Onizōo:</strong> As a Shura, his civility falls away into a ritualistic obsession with perfect violence. He speaks of killing as artistry and battles as performances. He exists purely to experience and create perfect violence, attempting to awaken that same bloodlust in others.</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>Onizōo is driven to find worthy opponents, corrupt others, and recreate the transcendent violence he felt when Arnox awakened his bloodlust. He seeks to forge new champions of brutality—warriors trapped in an eternal dance of death under his Crimson Moon Battlefield.</p>
