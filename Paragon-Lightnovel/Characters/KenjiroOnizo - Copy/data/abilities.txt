<ul>
  <li><strong>Master Swordsman:</strong> Centuries of combat have honed his technique to supernatural levels. He can predict opponents' moves through micro-expressions and body language, making him incredibly difficult to surprise or defeat. His dual-blade mastery reaches inhuman levels of precision and creativity.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Crimson Flame Blades:</strong> Onimaru and Oniyasha are permanently corrupted, weeping blood-flames that burn with supernatural agony. Onimaru can cut through spiritual barriers and energy constructs, while Oniyasha inflicts wounds that resist healing and continue burning with acidic blood-flame that melts through defenses like the fires of hell itself.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Chi Jūji (Blood Cross):</strong> His signature technique creates dimensional cuts in an X pattern that exist in multiple planes simultaneously, designed to sever the bonds between soul and body. The attack phases through conventional defenses and can only be countered by perfect combat instinct.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Chi Getsu Ryōiki (血月領域) (Crimson Moon Battlefield):</strong> His ultimate ability as a Shura—the power to transform any arena into his personal domain of violence. When activated, reality itself bends to create a nightmarish battlefield under an eternal crimson moon. In this space, the ground becomes soaked with the blood of countless battles, crimson flames dance through the air burning with the agony of his victims, time flows differently allowing for extended combat, his blood-flame attacks become exponentially more powerful, and opponents find their movements hindered by the weight of supernatural dread. This reality marble reflects his inner world—an endless battlefield where perfect violence reigns supreme.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Shura Resilience:</strong> As a demon born from hatred and bloodlust, he can continue fighting even with injuries that would kill normal beings. His hatred literally sustains him, and damage only feeds his fury.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Combat Instinct:</strong> His entire existence revolves around battle, giving him supernatural awareness of killing intent, fighting patterns, and tactical opportunities. He can sense worthy opponents from vast distances.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Corruption Aura:</strong> His presence gradually awakens bloodlust in others, making even peaceful individuals more aggressive and violent. This is how he "recruits" worthy opponents and spreads his influence.</li>
