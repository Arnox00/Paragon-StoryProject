<h3>Human Form (Miyamoto Kenjiro)</h3>
<p>Miyamoto Kenjiro appears as the epitome of a refined samurai master. Standing tall with an elegant, deceptively slender frame, he carries himself with the fluid grace of someone who has achieved perfect harmony between mind and body. His long, flowing black hair moves naturally with each motion, often catching the wind in a way that seems almost choreographed.</p>

<p>His most distinctive feature is his perpetually closed eyes—narrow, fox-like slits that give him an expression of serene contentment. When he smiles, which is often, it appears genuine and warm, creating an immediate sense of trust and comfort in those around him. This pleasant demeanor masks the calculating intelligence beneath, as he constantly analyzes everyone he meets as potential opponents.</p>

<p>He wears pristine traditional samurai attire: a perfectly maintained green kimono over dark hakama, with not a thread out of place. At his waist rest two masterwork katanas—Onimaru and Oniyasha—in their dormant state, appearing as elegant temple blades with ornate golden fittings. His hands are unmarked by the blackened fingertips of his later form, and his skin bears no trace of the crimson markings that will come to define him.</p>

<h3>Demon Form (Onizō)</h3>
<p>After his transformation into a Shura, he becomes something far more terrifying. His face remains hidden beneath the massive straw hat (sugegasa) that casts perpetual shadows, with only glowing eyes visible beneath its brim like twin embers burning in the darkness. He also appears to be wearing a yokai-like mask that has a horrifying grin.</p>

<p>His flowing black hair has transformed into living crimson flames—a physical manifestation of the demon of hatred burning within him. His once-pristine clothing is now tattered and worn, dissolving at the edges into red mist. The golden cord that ties his outfit is the only bright element remaining in his otherwise dark appearance.</p>

<p>His hands bear blackened fingertips, permanently stained by the blood of countless victims, and faint crimson markings resembling flowing blood vessels trace across his pale skin. Most terrifying of all are his twin katanas, now permanently stained crimson from his transformation. The blades seem to weep blood constantly, dripping with flames that burn like liquid agony—a corruption of their original sacred purpose as temple guardians.</p>
