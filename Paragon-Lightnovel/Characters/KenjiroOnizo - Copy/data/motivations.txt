<p>Miyamoto Kenjiro/Onizō is driven by an insatiable hunger for perfect combat experiences and the corruption of others. As a human, he sought increasingly dangerous opponents to feed his psychopathic need for violence while maintaining his facade of respectability. As a Shura, this has evolved into an eternal curse—he can never find satisfaction in victory or peace in defeat.</p>

<p>His encounter with Arnox represents the pinnacle of his existence—a moment of perfect violence and honest brutality that he constantly seeks to recreate or surpass. His interest in Ashur stems from this obsession, seeing the soul fragment as a chance to experience that perfect battle again while corrupting Arnox's bloodline.</p>

<p>His ultimate goal is not just personal satisfaction, but the creation of worthy opponents through corruption. He seeks to awaken the bloodlust in others, turning them into beings like himself—trapped in the beautiful agony of eternal combat. He represents the seductive nature of violence itself, offering power and purpose to those who embrace their darkest impulses.</p>

<p>Ultimately, he embodies the path that awaits any warrior who loses sight of why they fight. He serves as both antagonist and cautionary tale, showing what happens when the pursuit of strength becomes divorced from any higher purpose, when the means become the end, and when the warrior becomes the very monster they once fought against.</p>
