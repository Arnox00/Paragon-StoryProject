<h3>Human Form (Miyamoto Kenjiro)</h3>
<p>Kenjiro presents himself as the ideal of samurai refinement—polite, thoughtful, and deeply knowledgeable about martial arts and philosophy. He speaks with gentle wisdom and appears genuinely interested in others' wellbeing. This facade is so convincing that many seek him out as a mentor or guide, making him the perfect predator.</p>

<p>However, beneath this pleasant exterior lies the mind of a psychopath who views every interaction through the lens of combat. He compliments others' sword techniques while mentally cataloging their weaknesses. He discusses philosophy while fantasizing about how each person might die. His perpetually closed eyes hide not serenity, but constant calculation and predatory assessment.</p>

<p>He possesses an unsettling ability to remain calm in any situation, never showing surprise or fear even when facing death. This isn't courage—it's the absence of normal human emotional responses. He finds genuine joy only in combat, and everything else is merely a performance designed to lure in prey.</p>

<h3>Demon Form (Onizō)</h3>
<p>As a Shura, his mask of civility has largely fallen away, though he retains his formal speech patterns and samurai courtesies in a twisted mockery of his former self. He speaks about combat with the enthusiasm most people reserve for beloved hobbies, discussing the most efficient ways to kill with genuine excitement and religious fervor.</p>

<p>He becomes increasingly agitated when not fighting, like an addict denied their fix. His psychopathic tendencies are now fully unleashed, though he maintains enough of his original personality to appreciate worthy technique and respect honorable combat. He views each battle as both a test of skill and a ritual sacrifice to his demonic nature.</p>

<p>The corruption has amplified his worst traits while stripping away any remaining humanity. He now exists purely to experience and create perfect violence, seeing himself as an artist whose medium is death and whose canvas is the battlefield.</p>
