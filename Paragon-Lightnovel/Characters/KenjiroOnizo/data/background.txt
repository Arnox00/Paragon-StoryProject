<h3>The Path to Becoming Shura</h3>
<p>Miyamoto Kenjiro was born into a prestigious samurai family that operated hot springs in the Ashina lands, showing exceptional talent with the blade from an early age. However, unlike other warriors who fought for honor, duty, or protection, Kenjiro discovered an uncomfortable truth about himself—he genuinely enjoyed the act of killing. Not the victory, not the honor, but the precise moment when life left his opponent's eyes.</p>

<p>This realization didn't horrify him as it should have. Instead, it fascinated him. He began seeking out increasingly dangerous opponents under the guise of maintaining order, systematically hunting down temple guardians and sacred sites across the mountain villages. Each kill fed a growing hunger within him, gradually transforming him from a disciplined samurai into something far more dangerous.</p>

<h3>The Sacred Blades</h3>
<p>He acquired the cursed twin blades Onimaru and Oniyasha from a mountain temple after slaughtering its protectors, including the young priest Reveille's village guardians. These swords, originally forged to ward off evil spirits and protect the innocent, instead became conduits for his growing bloodlust. The irony was not lost on him—weapons meant to protect had become instruments of his corruption.</p>

<h3>The Fateful Encounter</h3>
<p>His path to becoming a Shura culminated when he encountered Arnox and Arielle exploring Fukuwa city during the annual crimson moon festival on their honeymoon. The unique couple had become the talk of the town—their exotic beauty and obvious power drawing attention. But Kenjiro sensed something deeper in Arnox: the dormant bloodlust of a warrior who had killed countless foes across multiple worlds.</p>

<p>Introducing himself as esteemed local royalty, Kenjiro offered them guidance about the festival and exclusive access to his family's private hot springs resort. His facade was perfect—the gracious host welcoming distinguished guests. It was at these hot springs that Arielle gave birth to Ashur after a passionate encounter with Arnox, and Kenjiro played the role of supportive attendant throughout.</p>

<p>However, the crimson moon's supernatural influence gradually eroded his self-control. During the intimate family moment, his mask finally slipped—he casually confessed to being responsible for the festival's missing people, the bodies found cleaved in the alleys. When Arnox righteously demanded a duel, Kenjiro initially tried to deflect, not understanding why his "pest control" was problematic.</p>

<p>Everything changed when Arnox drew Twilight's Peak. The sight of that magnificent nodachi filled Kenjiro with such awe that he immediately accepted the challenge. His facade dropped completely, revealing the bloodlusted psychopath beneath who craved to witness and awaken Arnox's true swordsmanship.</p>

<p>The battle was magnificent and terrible. For the first time in years, Kenjiro felt truly alive as Arnox's dormant battle instincts awakened. But when Arnox's Twilight Severance pierced his heart beneath the crimson moon, instead of finding peace in death, his hatred and bloodlust refused to let him pass on.</p>

<h3>The Crimson Rebirth</h3>
<p>Arnox, respecting his fallen opponent, performed a funeral ceremony on the Gojo Bridge. As the flames consumed Kenjiro's body under the crimson moon, his intense negative emotions fused with the yokai essence that permeates the Ashina lands. The fire that should have freed his soul instead became the crucible for his transformation into Onizō—a Shura bound to eternal unrest, his sacred blades forever corrupted by his burning hatred.</p>

<h3>Centuries of Wandering</h3>
<p>As Onizō, he became trapped in an endless cycle of seeking worthy opponents to feed his Shura bloodlust. Each battle only intensified his need for greater challenges, creating a never-ending spiral of violence. He haunts the Ashina lands, drawn to conflict and the scent of strong warriors, forever seeking to recreate that perfect moment of combat he experienced with Arnox—and to corrupt others as he himself was corrupted.</p>
