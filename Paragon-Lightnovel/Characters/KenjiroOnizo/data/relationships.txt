<h3>With Arnox Paragon</h3>
<p>Their relationship began with Kenjiro's challenge during Arnox's honeymoon—a moment of supreme irony that Kenjiro found delightful. He respected Arnox not as a person but as the ultimate expression of combat prowess and hidden bloodlust. During their battle, he experienced something approaching ecstasy when Arnox's true nature awakened.</p>
<p><em>"Your confession about that blade... magnificent, Arnox-san. We truly were the same—killers who simply dressed our violence in different clothes. Thank you for granting me transcendence through honest brutality."</em></p>
<p>Kenjiro held no grudge against Arnox for defeating him. Instead, he was grateful for the experience that allowed his transformation into something greater. As Onizō, he views Arnox as the catalyst for his evolution and the template for what he seeks to create in others.</p>

<h3>With Ashur Paragon</h3>
<p>When Onizō encounters Ashur decades later, he immediately recognizes both the soul fragment and the blade. The irony delights him beyond measure—facing the son wielding the very weapon that ended his mortal life.</p>
<p><em>"You know my blade? Onizō knows it well... I FELT IN MY GUTS after all! Heheheheheh!"</em> His maniacal laughter echoes across the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>"Ahhh, I remember... you were that infant child from back then. I remember how as a baby you gazed upon me and your father's duel with such intensity. Where did that love for combat go? Did you regress somehow?"</em></p>
<p>He sees their battle as the ultimate test—not just for himself, but for Ashur's growth as a warrior. Onizō deliberately parries and counters every technique Ashur attempts, taunting him mercilessly: <em>"I've already seen all these fancy tricks from your father! SHOW ME SOMETHING NEW, YOUNG PARAGON!"</em></p>
<p>His goal isn't simply victory, but awakening the bloodlust he believes lies dormant in Ashur's quiet nature. He wants to prove that despite Arnox's noble intentions, the cycle of violence cannot be broken—that Ashur will eventually embrace the same beautiful brutality that defined his father.</p>
<p>However, Ashur ultimately defeats him not through inherited violence, but by creating something entirely new—ice-based techniques that reflect his own quiet, contemplative nature. The poetic battle between ice and flame becomes a symbol of Ashur forging his own path beyond his father's shadow.</p>

<h3>With Reveille</h3>
<p>Discovering that Reveille is a survivor from the mountain temples creates an unexpected connection. As Onizō, he doesn't remember the specific massacre among his countless killings, but he recognizes the hatred and survivor's guilt that radiates from the young man.</p>
<p><em>"That conjuration magic... crude but effective. You've survived longer than most, boy. Tell me—did losing everything teach you the truth about strength? About the joy that comes from making others feel your pain?"</em></p>
<p>He sees potential in Reveille's trauma and guilt, viewing them as possible catalysts for awakening true killing intent. He's simultaneously dismissive of Reveille's "diluted" techniques and intrigued by his adaptation to survive, recognizing a kindred spirit shaped by loss and violence.</p>
