<ul>
  <li>Heavily inspired by Sasaki Kojiro from Vagabond manga, particularly his serene demeanor hiding deadly intent</li>
  <li>His name and dual-wield style (Nitoryu) references the famous swordsman from the Edo period, Miyamoto Musashi</li>
  <li>His Shura form/Yokai form is heavily inspired by Okada Iz≈ç's 2nd Ascension form from Fate/Grand Order - the "Man Slayer Izo"</li>
  <li>His flaming hair and the hatred from which he was reborn when his body was burned is a reference to the Demon of Hatred from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - his whole Shura concept follows the same theme</li>
  <li>His bloodied katanas and special ability "Crimson Moon Battlefield" is a reference to Unohana Retsu's Bankai from Bleach, while his flame-red katanas and powers reference blood flame magic from Elden Ring</li>
  <li>The twin blades Onimaru and Oniyasha were originally temple guardian swords, making their corruption into instruments of violence deeply ironic</li>
  <li>His perpetually closed eyes in human form are inspired by traditional depictions of enlightened monks, twisted into a symbol of predatory calculation</li>
  <li>The crimson moon that appears in his Reality Marble is the same moon under which he was killed and reborn as a Shura</li>
  <li>His encounter with Arnox during the honeymoon creates one of the most tragic ironies - corrupting a moment of new life (Ashur's birth) with death</li>
  <li>Despite being a psychopathic killer, he maintains traditional samurai etiquette even in his demon form, making him eerily polite</li>
