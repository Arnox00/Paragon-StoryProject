        <p>The <strong>Radiant Vigil</strong> is an ecclesiastical inquisition founded by the survivors of Saint Seraphiel's last stand. Born from the ashes of corruption, they are Heaven's most zealous hunters ‚Äî warrior-nuns who purify the taint of Gluttony with sanctified flame and unyielding judgment.</p>
        <p>They do not seek redemption for the corrupt. They seek annihilation.</p>

    <section class="content-section" id="origin">
      <h2>I. Origin of the Radiant Vigil</h2>
      <p>Before her wings, before her sanctification, Seraphiel was human ‚Äî a sister of the cloth and sworn protector of the weak. When Gluttony's corruption first seeped into the mortal world, her parish became one of the first to fall. She watched as friends and novices were devoured by the horrors birthed from Beelzebub, the Archdemon imprisoned in the pit known as The Maw ‚Äî a vast spiral of hunger beneath Hell's seventh ring.</p>
      
      <div class="lore-box">
        <h4>üåë The Maw and Its Curse</h4>
        <p>Beelzebub, the Lord of Endless Consumption, is not merely a demon ‚Äî he is a cosmic appetite, an engine that fuels Hell by devouring the souls of the damned. He is imprisoned, yet never still.</p>
        <p>From the depths he whispers, <em>"‚Ä¶hungry‚Ä¶"</em> ‚Äî and from those whispers, fragments of his essence bleed into the mortal realm as transmission vectors: cursed tomes, relics, or places that infect mortals with the Gluttony Curse.</p>
        <p>Those afflicted become grotesque vessels of endless hunger ‚Äî flesh twisting into mouths, bellies, and tendrils of living appetite. Among them was Vorenus, a corrupt bishop who bound a tome carved from Beelzebub's own flesh, and who would later devour the Inquisitor Marie Lionheart.</p>
      </div>

      <details class="expandable-section" open>
        <summary>Seraphiel's Stand</summary>
        <p>When the taint reached her city, Seraphiel did not flee. She led her sisters to defend the cathedral gates, holding the line against an army of Gluttony-born fiends. Her arms were torn from her body, her garments shredded, yet she refused to fall. When the dawn rose, she stood upright among the corpses of demons, bloodless but unbowed ‚Äî her body motionless yet still standing.</p>
        
        <p>It was then that Azrael, Archangel of Death, descended. He looked upon her ruined form and saw not a corpse, but devotion incarnate. He spoke not in command, but in reverence:</p>
        
        <blockquote class="divine-speech">
          "Thou hast fought as mine own.<br>
          Rise, warrior; die not for Heaven, but live in its glory."
          <cite>‚Äî Azrael, Archangel of Death</cite>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Her soul was taken from the mortal coil ‚Äî not to be judged, but to serve eternally. Azrael forged her anew in Heaven's fires, granting her wings of silver flame. Thus was born Seraphiel the Seraph, Heaven's blade, and the first mortal to join The Sanctified Order, Azrael's personal host of divine assassins.</p>
        
        <p>Those who survived her defense ‚Äî the young sisters she shielded ‚Äî wept, then swore to emulate her unyielding light. They took up her broken weapons and vowed vengeance upon all corruption born of Gluttony. Thus began the Radiant Vigil.</p>

    <!-- Doctrine -->
    <section class="content-section" id="doctrine">
      <h2>II. Doctrine of the Radiant Vigil</h2>
      
      <div class="codex-box">
        <h4>From the Codex Puritatis, "Verse of the Silver Flame"</h4>
        <blockquote class="codex-verse">
          "From the verse to contain thy flame:<br>
          Spare the innocent and the meek,<br>
          For they art thy charge and ward.<br>
          But upon the corrupted, show no mercy,<br>
          For sin feedeth sin,<br>
          And he who suffereth the unclean,<br>
          Becometh tainted himself."
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      
      <p>The Radiant Vigil interprets purity as absolute. Sin, to them, is not an act but a disease ‚Äî invisible, contagious, inevitable. They cleanse not merely bodies, but existence itself.</p>
      
      <p>Their sacred rite, <strong>Purification</strong>, does not kill ‚Äî it unmakes. The soul is seared into nothingness, denied Heaven, Hell, and memory alike. The Vigil believe this annihilation to be the truest mercy, for it ends corruption forever.</p>
      
      <p>Yet, beneath their terror lies genuine virtue. Even the most fanatical Inquisitor will lay down her life to protect a child, or shield the innocent from damnation ‚Äî as Seraphiel once did. But when faced with the corrupted, their compassion dies.</p>
      
      <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>A starving boy who steals to live?</strong> Purified.</p>
        <p><strong>An artist who paints the sin of lust?</strong> Erased.</p>
        <p><strong>A priest who doubts his faith?</strong> Burned from memory.</p>
      </div>
      
      <blockquote>"Kindness to the tainted is cruelty to the pure."</blockquote>
    </section>

    <!-- Duties -->
    <section class="content-section" id="duties">
      <h2>III. Duties and Hunts</h2>
      <p>The Vigil's most sacred charge is to hunt <strong>Gluttony's Proxies</strong> ‚Äî mortals or monsters touched by the fragments of Beelzebub's leaking essence. Wherever the taint of The Maw spreads ‚Äî in cursed tomes, cathedrals, or towns that vanish overnight ‚Äî the Radiant Vigil follows.</p>
      
      <p>They do not return until the corruption is gone. If they themselves are tainted in the process, they willingly submit to purification by their sisters.</p>
      
      <blockquote class="flame-quote">
        "From one flame, many burn.<br>
        From many flames, one light remains."
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Inquisitors travel in silence, cloaked in white and silver, their presence announced only by the acrid scent of sanctified fire. They investigate whispers of unusual hunger, unexplained disappearances, towns where food rots before it can be harvested. Where corruption is found, they do not merely kill ‚Äî they purify, leaving nothing but ash and holy flame.</p>

          <p><strong>Weapon:</strong> Sanctified Warhammer</p>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Active</p>
          <p><strong>Nature:</strong> Fragment of Divinity ‚Äî Arielle's cast-aside soul</p>
          <p class="member-description">Grace embodies judgment stripped of empathy ‚Äî a vessel of Seraphiel's original discipline but none of her warmth. Her strikes cause sinners to melt alive, bodies liquefying into screaming light as souls disintegrate. To her, mercy is blasphemy; annihilation is worship. Though she feels no memory of Arielle, she remains drawn to Heaven's power ‚Äî perhaps unconsciously seeking the ascension her "other self" once rejected.</p>

          <p class="member-description">An Inquisitor dispatched to investigate a vanishing town. She uncovered Vorenus, a bishop consumed by the Gluttony Curse and turned into a proxy demon. Vorenus defiled and consumed her, leaving her upper body as a mockery ‚Äî a living puppet used to lure more victims. Her soul was later freed by Grace. The Vigil regard Marie as a martyr, her purity restored through sacrifice.</p>

      <h2>V. The Holy Purpose</h2>
      <p>To the faithful, the Radiant Vigil are Saint Seraphiel's Daughters ‚Äî keepers of divine fire, burning away corruption wherever it festers.</p>
      
      <p>To demons, they are extinction made flesh.</p>
      
      <p>To Heaven, they are useful sinners ‚Äî mortals too zealous for paradise, yet too righteous for Hell.</p>
      
      <p>Their founder's final teaching is carved into every blade they wield:</p>
      
      <blockquote class="final-quote">
        "Purity is not peace.<br>
        Purity is flame.<br>
        And flame careth not whom it devoureth."
